# Workflow Templates Repository
This repository contains the templates to Ayehu's existing workflows. You're welcome to use the templates, modify them, and then [contribute back whatever new workflows you design!](https://github.com/Ayehu/custom-workflows)

## What are Workflows?
The Ayehu NG platform includes a Workflow Designer - you can design and execute a variety of IT and business processes, and the processes created can be set to run automatically either in response to a specific event, alert or incident, or as part of regularly scheduled tasks. You can also export your work to a file in the XML format, and import workflows shared by your peers who have done the same.
