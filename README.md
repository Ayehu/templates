# Workflow Templates
The Ayehu NG platform includes a Workflow Designer - you can design and execute a variety of IT and business processes, and the processes created can be set to run automatically either in response to a specific event, alert or incident, or as part of regularly scheduled tasks. You can also export your work to a file in the XML format, and import workflows shared by your peers who have done the same.

We will be releasing more and more workflows for interesting scenarios, so stay tuned. If you are working on an interesting workflow of your own, feel free to send us a Pull Request and let's build it together.

For information on importing and exporting workflows, please refer to the [Ayehu NG User Guide](https://support.ayehu.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010539853-Ayehu-NG-User-Guide).
